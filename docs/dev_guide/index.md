## Developer guide

This section is for contributors and advanced users.

It explains how Kiln is structured and how to extend the env-bundle → Genesis pipeline.

### Key modules

- `kiln/ui/*`: Qt UI (project browser + viewport)
- `kiln/envio/*`: env-bundle schema + IO + exporter
- `kiln/sim/genesis/*`: Genesis adapter (`GenesisSim`)
- `kiln/actors/*`: higher-level actor abstractions (designed for future Gymnasium exporter)
